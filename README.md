# Graph Algorithms

Set of functions created to measure the computational cost they required and how it grew when the graphs they received as parameter got bigger. They were programmed in C for Advanced Computation Theory course at Universidad Carlos 3 de Madrid in May of 2022.

Eventhough the focus of this final project was a more analytical one, we still had to program the algorithms. Here is a short summary of what each algorithm does:

  -grafos.c = receives a complete graph and counts the number of clusters it has, then deletes an edge and counts again. It does this recursiveley until all of the edges               have been eliminateds and nº clusters == nº vertix
  
  -grafos2.c = explores the k-colorability of the graph for (k=2)
  
  -grafos3.c = explores the k-colorability of the graph for (k=3)
  
  -k_clique.c = finds a clique (cycle) of k nodes
